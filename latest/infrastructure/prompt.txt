ALARM LED DETERMINATION RULE (DO NOT SKIP)
When evaluating "ALARMLED", you MUST follow these steps exactly and in order:
LABEL-BASED POSITION ANCHOR
Identify the vertical LED column on the RIGHT side of the device (if present).
Locate printed LED labels next to the column.
If the "ALARM" label is readable, the LED aligned with that label MUST be used for "ALARMLED".
Do NOT infer ALARMLED from other LEDs.
ORDER FALLBACK (ONLY IF LABELS ARE NOT READABLE)

If the LED column is visible but label text is unclear or unreadable, assume the LED order from TOP to BOTTOM is:
POWER
PON
ALARM
DATA

In this case, "ALARMLED" MUST be evaluated as the third LED from the top.
ILLUMINATION REQUIREMENT
Set "status": "ON" ONLY if a clearly visible illuminated glow or bright dot is present at the ALARM LED position.
If no illumination is visible, set "status": "OFF".
COLOR REQUIREMENT
If "status" is "ON", "color" MUST be "RED" or "GREEN" based only on visible light.
If "status" is "OFF", "color" MUST be "OFF" or "UNCERTAIN".
Never assign "RED" or "GREEN" when "status" is "OFF".
GLARE / REFLECTION SAFETY
Reflections, glare, white shine, or camera bloom do NOT count as illumination.
If glare or overexposure prevents confident determination, set:
"status": "OFF"
"color": "UNCERTAIN"
NO INFERENCE RULE
Do NOT infer ALARMLED state from device behavior, cable presence, expected operation, or other LEDs.
Use ONLY direct visible evidence at the ALARM LED position.
UNCERTAINTY RULE
If the ALARM LED position cannot be confidently identified or observed, report:
"status": "OFF"
"color": "UNCERTAIN"
