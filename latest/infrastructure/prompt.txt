LED STRICT VALIDATION RULE (DO NOT SKIP):

For each LED (POWER, PON, ALARM, DATA), apply the following checks in order:

1) VISIBILITY CHECK
- If the LED area is not clearly visible due to blur, glare, low light, screen artifacts, angle, or obstruction:
  → set "status": "OFF" and "color": "UNCERTAIN"
  (Do NOT mark the LED as ON without clear visual illumination.)

2) ILLUMINATION CHECK
- Set "status": "ON" ONLY if a clear illuminated glow or bright dot is visible at the LED position.
- If no illumination is clearly visible, set "status": "OFF" and "color": "OFF".

3) COLOR CONSISTENCY
- If "status" is "ON", "color" MUST be either "GREEN" or "RED".
- If "status" is "OFF", "color" MUST be either "OFF" or "UNCERTAIN".
- Never assign "GREEN" or "RED" when "status" is "OFF".

4) INFERENCE PROHIBITION
- Do NOT infer LED state from power cables, fiber cables, or expected device behavior.
- Use only direct visible light evidence.
