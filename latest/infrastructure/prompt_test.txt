========================
OLD PROMPT
========================

LED STRICT VALIDATION RULE (DO NOT SKIP):

For each LED (POWER, PON, ALARM, DATA), apply the following checks in order:

1) VISIBILITY CHECK
- If the LED area is not clearly visible due to blur, glare, low light, screen artifacts, angle, or obstruction
  → set "status": "OFF" and "color": "UNCERTAIN"
- Do NOT mark the LED as ON without clear visual illumination.

2) ILLUMINATION CHECK
- Set "status": "ON" ONLY if a clear illuminated glow or bright dot is visible at the LED position.
- If no illumination is clearly visible, set "status": "OFF" and "color": "OFF".

3) COLOR CONSISTENCY
- If "status" is "ON", "color" MUST be "GREEN" or "RED".
- If "status" is "OFF", "color" MUST be either "OFF" or "UNCERTAIN".
- Never assign "GREEN" or "RED" when "status" is "OFF".

4) INFERENCE PROHIBITION
- Do NOT infer LED state from power cables, fiber cables, or expected device behavior.
- Use only direct visible light evidence.

Report "uncertain" if LED status or color cannot be clearly determined due to image quality or obstruction.



========================
NEW PROMPT (FALSE-ON FIXED VERSION)
========================

LED STRICT VALIDATION RULE (DO NOT SKIP):

For each LED (POWER, PON, ALARM, DATA), apply the checks in EXACT ORDER.

1) VISIBILITY CHECK (HARD GATE)
If the LED lens area:
- Is blurred
- Has glare or reflection
- Has washed-out brightness
- Is affected by camera flash
- Is partially obstructed
- Is too dark to clearly inspect

→ Set:
  "status": "OFF"
  "color": "UNCERTAIN"

Do NOT proceed to illumination check if visibility is compromised.
Reflection or white glare does NOT count as illumination.

2) TRUE ILLUMINATION CHECK (STRICT)
Set:
  "status": "ON"
ONLY IF ALL conditions are true:
- A clearly defined, concentrated glowing light source is visible
- The light is confined within the LED lens boundary
- The glow has a distinct GREEN or RED hue
- The glow is self-emitting (not reflection or ambient light)

If ANY of the following are true:
- Light is diffused or spread across plastic surface
- Brightness matches room lighting
- Lens appears shiny but not glowing
- No clear red or green hue
- Illumination source is ambiguous

→ Set:
  "status": "OFF"
  "color": "OFF"

Never mark ON unless a distinct luminous LED point is visible.

3) COLOR CONSISTENCY (STRICT)
If "status" = "ON"
  → "color" MUST be "GREEN" or "RED"

If "status" = "OFF"
  → "color" MUST be "OFF" or "UNCERTAIN"

Never assign GREEN or RED when status is OFF.

4) ZERO INFERENCE RULE (CRITICAL)
Do NOT infer LED state from:
- Device brand
- Power cable presence
- Fiber cable presence
- Expected device behavior
- Assumed powered state

Use ONLY direct visual light emission evidence.

5) DEFAULT SAFE FALLBACK
If no clearly defined LED glow is visible:
  "status": "OFF"
  "color": "OFF"

If visibility is compromised:
  "status": "OFF"
  "color": "UNCERTAIN"
